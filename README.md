# OBJECT-DETECTION-USING-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
## MINI PROJECT - II
### Created by @akr1912 & @abhiprshekiya
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
In this project, we are creating a Software, based on Object Detection which we have built using OpenCV, AI. Object detection is one of the most advanced  and futuristic tasks in computer vision. Its task is to find all the objects present in the surroundings in real time, and determine the category and location of the objects in real time. Object detection is widely used and has strong practical value and research prospects. 
### The features of this project includes:
Allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video in real time.
Object detection is widely used in the field of computer vision and crucial for a variety of applications.
Assist us to understand and analyze the scenes in videos and images.
